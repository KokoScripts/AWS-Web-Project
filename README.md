# AWS-Web-Project
Designing and building a simple web application from scratch on AWS using five different services - Amplify, Lambda, IAM, API Gateway and DynamoDB.

Here is a step-by-step on how I designed and built a full web app on AWS by following [Tutorial by Tiny Tech Tutorials](https://youtu.be/7m_q1ldzw0U?si=-u2LWjtARnRJilov) YouTube Tutorial.

### Requirements
- AWS account
- Text editor (e.g Notepad, VSCode, or anyone you are familiar with)
- Basic knowledge of AWS
  
### Level
Beginner 

#### Step One - Create the HTML
1. Create a text file on your device and name it index.html.
2. Launch your preferred text editor.
3. Open the html file you created in your text editor.
4. Copy and paste the html content under this project into that file. Save it.
5. Zip/compress the index.html file on your device. It should have the name index.zip

#### Step Two - Deploy the file on AWS Amplify
1. Sign into your AWS account. On the console, Navigate to Amplify.
